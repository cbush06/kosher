Kosher is a tool that merges several technologies together to automate and simplify functional testing. These include:
* Web Drivers (https://agouti.org/): automates tests by remote-controlling browsers
* Cucumber/Gherkin (https://github.com/DATA-DOG/godog): enables tests scripts to be written in human-readable, BDD-compatible scripts
* Virtual File System (https://github.com/spf13/afero): abstracts away differences between operating systems making the application platform-agnostic and easier to test
* Command-line parser (https://github.com/spf13/cobra): enables powerful, maintainable, and user-friendly CLI control
* Configuration-file parser (https://github.com/spf13/viper): simplifies use of JSON-based configuration files
