## Gherkin IDE

![VS Code]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/vscode-logo.png)

An Integrated Development Environment that supports Gherkin syntax is essential. By *supports*, we mean it color codes Gherking syntax and can auto-format your test scripts.

We highly recommend Visual Studio Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)

![Gherkin Plugin]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/gherkin-plugin.png)

We also recommend you use the **Cucumber (Gherkin) Full Support** VS Code extension to aid in formatting and autocompletion. You can read more about the extensiont at [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete).

## Version Control / Bash Terminal

![Git]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/git.png)

Git is our version control tool of choice. Additionally, **if you are using Windows**, the Git installation comes with a BASH emulation terminal that serves as a user-friendly alternative to the Windows command prompt.

You can download the Git installation at [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Web Debugging Proxy

![Fiddler]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/fiddler.png)

There may be times when you need a debugging proxy on your local machine. You can use such a tool to add HTTP headers and inspect requests. For Windows machines, we recommend Fiddler by Telerik. You can download this software for free at [https://www.telerik.com/fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler).

![Portswigger]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/portswigger-web-security.png)

If you are working on a Linux machine, we recommend using Portswigger's Burp Proxy. You can download the community edition free at [https://portswigger.net/burp](https://portswigger.net/burp).
