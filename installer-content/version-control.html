    <h1>Terminal and Version Control</h1>
    <p align="center"><img src="git.png" /></p>
    <p>We highly recommend using Git as your version control tool. Additionally, <strong>if you are using Windows</strong>, the Git installation comes with a BASH emulation terminal that serves as a user-friendly alternative to the Windows command prompt.</p>
    <p>You can download the Git installation at <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>.</p>
